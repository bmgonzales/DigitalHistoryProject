	<h1>Latinos in South Texas:</h1>
    <h2>An Interactive Guide</h2>
    <br/><br/>
    <p>Latinos in South Texas: An Interactive Guide is an online reference source on Latino issues in San Antonio and South Texas in the form of an interactive map. Since most historical research in Chicana/o civil rights has been primarily centered on the U.S. west coast, this project aims to help close the gap in the literature by making visible the untold Chicana/o history of South Texas, including topics such as history, policy, politics, civil rights, education, people and institutions.</p>
